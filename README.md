# Metis-Project-5

### Summary
NLP Analysis on Towards Data Science Blogs.
Sometimes picking a project is difficult;
Someone should make a program that generates project ideas. 
So, I decided to give it a shot!
### Impact
For this project I will do a NLP analysis of the 35000+ articles published in the Towards Data Science publication.  The cross-section of problems to be solved and tools we can use to solve them is huge and we often look online for inspiration.  Sometimes landing onto the Medium publication.  Using those blog posts, I want to provide insight into:
* rising topics in popularity
* past topics and projects
* how are data scientists talking within the community

My goal is to organize the articles into unique clusters and to provide a commentary on the context of the publication.
