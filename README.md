# Metis-Project-5

### Summary
NLP Analysis on Towards Data Science Blogs.
Sometimes picking a project is difficult;
Someone should make a program that generates project ideas. 
So, I decided to give it a shot!
### Impact
For this project I will do a NLP analysis of the 35000+ articles published in the Towards Data Science publication.  The cross-section of problems to be solved and tools we can use to solve them is huge and we often look online for inspiration.  Sometimes landing onto the Medium publication.  Using those blog posts, I want to provide insight into:
* rising topics in popularity
* past topics and projects
* advice for creator (if youâ€™re driven to get more claps)
Time permitting I would build a recommendation system to suggest articles based on level of technical writing/topic interest.  Maybe use a text generation program to write random article blurbs/abstracts.
### Data
All articles published to TowardsDataScience prior to 11/19
### Backup
Sentiment analysis on Yelp Reviews from the Yelp Dataset
